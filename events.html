            <h2 class="mb-3">Boo Grams</h2>
            <h7 class="mb-3">October 31, 2020</h7>
            <p>Due to the pandemic, we knew it would not be safe for our members to go trick-or-treating.
              Also, our club needed to raise money to buy new technology for our members.
              That's why we decided to host a Halloween-themed fundraiser called Boo Grams.
              In the fundraiser, both members and non-members could choose from 3 different drinks, with or without boba, from Happy Lemon.
              Then, GWC would deliver the drinks right to their doorsteps, along with a free Halloween goody bag filled with candy!
              This was a lot safer than hosting an in-store fundraiser, but we still made sure to follow proper sanitation and social distancing procedures.
              The fundraiser was a huge success, and we hope to do more fundraisers like this one in the future.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-3">Guest Speaker Event</h2>
            <h7 class="mb-3">February 24, 2020</h7>
            <p>Girls Who Code at Irvington hosted an event in which speakers from
              various tech fields came in to talk to members of the club. The speakers were Michael K. Zhang,
              Harvard alumni and the co-founder/chief-instructor at AI camp, and Yatish Turakhia, a student at
              Stanford who worked in Microsoft, Apple, and Qualcomm. Students had the opportunity to talk to
              the speakers and ask questions that they had about the techfield. Zhang and Turakhia were great
              speakers and Girls Who Code hopes to see them again.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Field Trip to the San Jose Tech Museum of Innovation</h2>
            <h7 class="mb-3">December 14, 2019</h7>
            <p> Girls Who Code at Irvington had the opportunity to take seven members
              to the Tech Museum of Innovation. The students were able to get to know each other, participate
              in many activites, and explore the museum. Although time was limited, the members were able to
              walk through the whole museum and even do an activity where they grew their own bacteria. The
              field trip was fun and educational, allowing the students to expand their horizons.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Factory Tea Bar Fundraiser</h2>
            <h7 class="mb-3">April 18, 2019</h7>
            <p>Girls Who Code at Irvington hosted its first ever fundraiser! It was
              coordinated with the Computer Science Club and was hosted at Factory Tea Bar after school. The
              officers passed out fliers to customers allowing them to donate 20% of their purchases to Girls
              Who Code at Irvington. At the end of the day, the club made $80 and gained a lot of experience.
              This success is just the beginning and Girls Who Code at Irvington is sure to have more!</p>
