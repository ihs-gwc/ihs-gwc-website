# cPanel
We are using cPanel to host our website. Files will be uploaded to cPanel via [pull deployment](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/web-services/guide-to-git-deployment/#manual-or-pull-deployment). Let us know if you have made a change on GitHub, so we can upload and deploy it on cPanel.

# contributions
Any contributions on GitHub are appreciated! Just make sure that if you add a new folder or file that's not inside a folder, update .cpanel.yml to include the folder or file. Otherwise, your changes might not show up on cPanel and the website.
